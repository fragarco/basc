In computer science, Backus–Naur Form (BNF) is a metasyntax used to express 
context-free grammars: that is, a formal way to describe formal languages. 
John Backus and Peter Naur developed a context free grammar to define the syntax
of a programming language by using two sets of rules: i.e., lexical rules and
syntactic rules.

BNF is widely used as a notation for the grammars of computer programming languages,
instruction sets and communication protocols, as well as a notation for representing
parts of natural language grammars. Many textbooks for programming language theory
and/or semantics document the programming language in BNF.

The above text and the examples that helped to shape the BNF grammar for the
Amstrad Locomotive BASIC are taken from:

INTRODUCTION

The assimilation of the terminology and the notation adopted in this chapter is essential. Various types of brackets explain the entry of the commands; thus start with you to familiarize with the significance of each one.

The commands without hooks must stay just as they are. It is the case, for example, about the command:

    END

When an element appears between angular brackets, < > like:

    <line number>

... these brackets should neither be typed, nor what they contain. The example above indicates the type of data necessary for the command. For example:

    EDIT <line number>

... mean that you must type:

    EDIT 100

The brackets ( ) MUST be typed just as they are. In the example:

    COS(<numeric expression>)

... the numerical expression must be between brackets. For example:

    PRINT COS(45)

To finish, the hooks contain the optional elements about a command or a function. 

    RUN [<line number>]

For example, the command can then be entered in two manners:

    RUN  ... or ... RUN 100


Specials characters

& or &H    Prefixes for a hexadecimal number
&X            Prefixes for a binary number
#                Prefixes for an inputs/outputs chanel

Types of data

Alphanumeric chains can contain from 0 to 255 characters and are indicated by <alphanumeric chain>. You can associate a chain with another one with the sign + so much that the size result does not exceed 255 characters.

The wholes numbers vary from -32768 to + 32767 and the real numbers from -1.7E+38 to +1.7E+38, the smallest number higher than zero being 2.9E-39 and each number having 9 to 10 significant figures.

A <numerical expression> is an expression which leads to a numerical value. That can be numbers, or a numeric variable, or numbers operating with numeric variables, about all that is not <alphanumeric chain>.

A <chanel number> is referred to a <numerical expression> to indicate a screen window, a printer, a cassette or a diskette to which the text must be forwarded.

A <list of element> describes a parameter including a list of elements separated by commas. This list, being able to contain one or more elements, is limited by the line lengh.

Various indicators of data type:

% Whoole
!   Reals (by defect)
$  Alphanumeric an numeric (alphanumeric) chain

We will give the key words of BASIC AMSTRAD in the following form:

KEY WORD

Syntax

Example

Description

Associated key words


Key words ares:

COMMANDS     : operations executed direcly
FUNCTIONS      : operations intervening in an expression
OPERATORS     : act with mathematical arguments

At the time of the listing of a program, the BASIC transforms in capital letters all the key words typed in small letters. The examples of this chapter are in capital letters such as they appear after a listing. It will be however preferable that you type them with small letters because the key words containing an error will remain LISTing witht small letters, thus revealing you your typing errors.



Key words...


ABS

ABS(<numerical expression>)

    PRINT ABS(-67,98)
        67.98

FUNCTION: Give the ABSolute value of the expression between brackets. The negative numbers thus lose their minus sign.

Associated key words: SGN




AFTER

AFTER <chronometer time>[,<chronometer number>] GOSUB <line number>

    10 AFTER 250 GOSUB 60:CLS
    20 PRINT"Guess a letter in 5 seconds"
    30 a$=INKEY$:IF flag=1 THEN END
    40 IF a$<>CHR$(INT(RND*26+97)) THEN 30
    50 PRINT a$;"  is exact, you win !"
    55 SOUND 1,478:SOUND 1,358:END
    60 PRINT "Too late. I win !"
    70 SOUND 1,2000:flag=1:RETURN
    run

COMMAND: Call a subroutine AFTER a delay. The <chronometer time> indicates the duration of waiting in multiples of 0,02 second. The <chronometer number> (which can be 0,1,2 or 3) precise one which of the four chronometers it is necessary to use. Each 4 chronometers can be associated with a subroutine.

Associated key words: EVERY, REMAIN, RETURN




AND

<argument> AND <argument>

    IF "alan" < "bernard" AND "dog" > "cat" THEN PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"
    true
    IF "bernard" < "alan" AND "cat" > "dog" THEN PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"
    false
    IF "alan" < "bernard" AND "cat" > "dog" THEN PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"
    false
    ....
    PRINT 1 AND 1
    1
    PRINT 0 AND 0
    0
    PRINT 1 AND 0
    0

OPERATOR: Carry out Boolean operations by bits on the whole numbers. Is equal to 0 except when the two bits of arguments are equal to 1.

Associated key words: OR, NOT, XOR.




ASC

ASC(<alphanumeric chain>)

    PRINT ASC("x")
        120

FUNCTION: Give the numerical value of the first character of a character string.


Associated key words: CHR$




ATN

ATN(<numerical expression>)

    PRINT ATN(1)
        0.785398163

FUNCTION: Calculate the Arc TaNgent (reducing the <numerical expression> to a real number in radians ranging between - PI/2 and + PI/2) of the value given.
Note that the commands DEG and RAD can beings used to specify explicitly that the result will be expressed respectively in degrees or radians

Associated key words: COS, DEG, RAD, SIN, TAN




AUTO

AUTO [<line number>][,<increment>]

    AUTO 100,50

COMMANDE: Generate AUTOmatically the line numbers. The optional parameter <line number> gives the first line number to be generated. If you do not specify it, the lines are generated from 10.

The <increment>, also optional, fixes the interval between the line numbers. It will be equal to 10 if not specified. If a line number already used is generated, the contents of this line appear on the screen and can be modified. The posted line is then replaced in memory after activation of the [RETURN] key. To stop the automatic classification of the lines, activate the key [ESC].

Associated key words: Nothing



BIN$

BIN$ ( <whole number without sign>[,<whole number>] )

    PRINT BIN$(64,8)
    01000000

FUNCTION: Product a BINary string representing the value of the <whole number without sign>, using the number of binary digits indicated by the second <whole number> (between 0 and 16). If this number is too large, the result starts with as many zero as necessary. If it is too small, the result is not truncated but converted into as many digits as necessary.

The <whole number without sign> to convert into binary must lie between -32768 and 65535.

Associated key words:  DEC$, HEX$, STR$




BORDER

    60 PRINT"border";a;",";b
    70 FOR t=1 TO 500
    80 NEXT t,b,a
    run

COMMAND: Change the border screen color. If two colors are indicated, they alternate at the speed determined by the command SPEED INK, if necessary. The values go from 0 to 26.

Associated key words:  SPEED INK




BREAK

(See ON BREAK CONT, ON BREAK GOSUB, ON BREAK STOP)




CALL

CALL <adress>[,<list of:<parameter>]

                                                                                                 [,<envelope section>]

    10 ENT 1,10,-50,10,10,50,10
    20 SOUND 1,500,200,10,,1
    run

COMMAND: Defines the Tonality ENveloppe specified by the <envelope number> (between 1 and 15) used with the command SOUND.  If the <envelope number> is negative (between -1 and -15) the envelope is repeated until the end of the sound duration fixed by the command SOUND.

Each <envelope section> can contain 2 or 3 parameters.

In the case of three parameters, those are:

<number of steps> , <step amplitude> , <step duration>.

Parameter 1: <number of steps>

Specify the <number of steps> of tonality variation inside the <envelope section>. For example, in a note section during 10 seconds, you can fix 10 steps of 1 second each one. In this case, the <number of steps> will be 10.

The <number of steps> can vary from 0 to 239.

Parameter 2: <step amplitude>

Must be between -128 and +127. The negative steps increase the height of the note, the positive steps lower it. The minimal sound period is 0.

Parameter 3: <step duration>

Specify the duration of a step, by 0.01 second units. It can vary from 0 to 255 (0 has the value 256), the maximum step duration is thus 2,56 seconds. If you only use two parameters, they are:

<sound period>,<step duration>


Parameter 1: <sound period>

Give the new period value. (see parameter 2 of the SOUND command)

Parameter 2: <step duration>

Specify the single step duration in units of 0,01 seconds. Can vary between 0 and 255 (0 having value 256), so 2,56 seconds.


GENERALITIES

The total steps duration should not exceed the parameter <duration> of command SOUND, because the sound finishes before to have crossed the totality of the steps. (the remainder of the tonality envelope is then ignored). In the same way, if the <duration> of the SOUND command exceeds the total duration of the steps, the sound continues after having crossed all the steps and stay constant to the final tonality.

The command ENT can be accompanied by 5 different <enveloppe sections> (each one constituted with the 2 or 3 parameters above).

The first step of a tonality envelope is executed immediately.

Each time that a new envelope is allocated to a determined enveloppe number, the preceding definition is lost.

An <envelope number> without <envelope section> cancels all the preceding specifications. .

    10 ENV 1,15,-1,10,15,,10
    20 SOUND 1,200,300,15,1
    run

COMMAND:

Defines the ENveloppe of Volume to the <envelope number> (between 1 and 15), used with the command SOUND.

It can contain 2 or 3 parameters:

For 3 parameters:

<number of steps> , <step amplitude> , <step duration>.


Parameter 1: <number of steps>

Specify the <number of steps> of volume than a sound must cross in the <envelope section>. For example, in a 10 seconds section, you can fix 10 volume steps of one second. In this case, the <number of steps> is equal to 10.

The <number of steps> can vary from 0 to 127.

Parameter 2: <step amplitude>

Can vary the volume from 0 to 15 compared to the preceding step. The 16 different volumes are the same ones as those of the SOUND command. The parameter <step amplitude> can however vary from -128 to +127. The volume come back to  0 after having reached 15.

Parameter 3: <step duration>

Specify the duration of a step, by 0.01 second units. Can vary from 0 to 255 (0 has the  value 256), that is to say 2,56 seconds.


For 2 parameters:

<hardware envelope>,<envelope period>

Parameter 1: <hardware envelope>

Specify the value to be sent to the envelope register contained in the sound generator.

Parameter 2: <envelope period>

Specify the value to be sent to the envelope period registers contained in the sound generator.

The use of hardware envelopes supposes the knowledge of the hardware. If you do not have it, it is better to use a software envelope integrating a adequate <step duration> parameter.


GENERALITIES

The steps total duration should not exceed the parameter <duration> of the SOUND command, the sound then finishes before to have crossed all the volume steps (the remainder of the envelope is ignored).

In the same way, if the parameter of <duration> of the SOUND command exceeds the total duration of the steps, the sound continues after having crossed all the steps of volume and remains constant to the final volume.

The command ENV can contain 5 different <envelope sections> (constituted of the 2 or 3 parameters above).

The first step of a <tonality envelope> is executed immediately.

Each time that a new envelope is allotted to a determined envelope number, the preceding definition is lost.

The specification of an <envelope number> without <envelope section> cancels all the preceding values.

    KEY 11,"border 13:paper 0:pen 1:ink 0,13:ink 1,0:mode 2:list"+CHR$(13)

Press the [ENTER] key

COMMAND: Associate a chain to the KEY corresponding to the <logical key number> specified. There are 32 logical key numbers (from 0 to 31) occupying the keys 128 to 159. Keys 128 (0 on the digital keyboard) to 140 ([CONTROL][ENTER] on the digital keyboard) are associated by defect to the figures 0 to 9, to the decimal point, to [RETURN] and to RUN"[RETURN] - (for the tape), but can be associated to other chains if necessary. The logical key numbers 13 to 31 (keys 141 to 159) are assigned to null strings by defect but can be extended and associated to the keys, using the KEY DEF command.

The <logical key number> provided in the KEY command must ranging between 0 and 31 or 128 and 159 to correspond to the keys physical numbers located in chapter "Cpc 6128 - Documentation"

The specified chain should not exceed 120 characters. The going beyond of this limit involves an error (5) "Improper argument".

Associated key words: KEY DEF

KEY DEF <key number>,<repetition>[,<normal>[,<with shift>[,with control]]]

    KEY 159,"it is the key TAB"
    KEY DEF 68,1,159

Press the [TAB] key

COMMAND: Defines the logical KEY value DEFines by its physical number, ranging between 0 and 79 (see the illustration in chapter "Cpc 6128 - Documentation"). The parameters <normal>, <with shift> and <with control> must contain the values to be sent when the key is pressed, alone, with [SHIFT] or with [CONTROL]. These parameters are optional.

The parameter <repetition> makes it possible to activate and desactivate the auto-repetition function (1 or 0). The speed of this one is adjustable by the command SPEED KEY.

In the example above, the KEY 159 (corresponding to the logical number 31) is initially associated with a chain. The command KEY DEF defines then the KEY 68 ([TAB]) to activate the auto-repetition (1) and send the value <normal> 159 when the key is pressed.

To return to the normal mode:

    KEY DEF 68,0,9

...9 being the normal ASCII value of [TAB]

    70 PRINT b$,b$
    run

COMMAND: Transmits the <list of: <article to print> or to post on the indicated channel, (# 0 per defect).

The semicolon indicates to the computer that an article must be immediately printed following the precedent. However, if it is too long to be on the same line, the computer go to the line anyway.

The comma indicates that an article must be positioned with the following tabulation. However, if the print or the posting of the preceding article overflows on the indicated tabulation, the computer shifts the new article with an additional tabulation.



PRINT SPC
PRINT TAB

PRINT [#<channel number>,][<list of: <article to print>][;]

    80 NEXT
    run

SPC print the number of empty spaces indicated by the <whole number> before printing or posting the article indicated, provided that this one can be put completely on the line. It is thus useless to use the semicolon with the command SPC.

TAB print, starting from the left margin, the number of empty spaces indicated before printing or posting the indicated article, provided that this one can be put on the line. The semicolon is thus useless after TAB. If the cursor has already exceeded the required position, a carriage return is executed before the tabulation.

    run

PRINT USING makes it possible to define the print format of an expression transmitted by the command PRINT. One defines for that the <format model> with which one wishes to appear the expression. One uses as <separator> either a comma, or a semicolon. The <format model> is a character string made up with the following « field indicators »:


Numericals formats

In a number:

#  Each sign # indicate the site of a figure.
    Example: ######

.   Indicate the site of the decimal point (equivalent with our comma).
    Example:######.##

,   (Reserve a space). This sign, being able to appear only immediately before the decimal point, indicates that the figures located on the left of the decimal point will be laid out by groups of three (corresponding to the thousands) separate between them by a comma
    Example:######,.##

Framing of a number:

££   (Reserve two spaces). Indicate that the sign £ will appear immediately before the first digit or the decimal point, i.e. on one of the sites reserved for digits.
       Example: ££######,.##

**   (Reserve two spaces). Indicate that all the empty spaces located before the number will be filled by asterisks.
       Example: **######,.##

**£   (Reserve three spaces). Add the options ** and ££, i.e. the asterisks at the head and the sign £ preceding immediately the number.
         Example: **£######,.##

$$    (Reserve two spaces). Indicate that the sign $ will appear immediately on the left than the first digit or decimal point, i.e. on sites reserved to digits.
        Example:$$######,.##

**$  (Reserve three spaces). Add the options ** and $$, i.e. the asterisks at the head and the sign $ preceding immediately the number.
        Example: **$######,.##

+      Indicate that one wishes to see appearing the sign of the number. This sign will appear before the number if the + is located at the beginning of the <model of format> and after the number if it is located to the end.
        Example: +####.####

-       The sign - can appear only TO THE END of the mask. It asks the presence of the sign - after any negative number or any negative exponent. In the absence of this specification, the sign - appears by defect before the negative number.
        Example:####.####-

^^^^  Indicate that the number must appear with exponent. The signs ^^^^ are placed AFTER the last site of digits, but BEFORE any final sign + or -
         Example: #.####^^^^+

The maximum length of the <model of format> of a number is 20 characters. The numbers are rounded with the number of signs indicated.

If a format is too small to contain the expression:

    PRINT USING "####";12345678

... this one is not truncated, but appears in its entirety, preceded by the sign % indicating a «erroneous format».

    70 PRINT:PRINT"With  &  =  ";
    80 PRINT USING "&";a$
    90 GOTO 90
    run

!   indicate that only the first character of the chain must appear.
    Example: !

\<espaces>\
    Indicate that only the x first characters of the chain must appear, x being equal to the length of the format (bars included).
    Example:\            \

&   Indicate that the chain must appear «just as it is».
      Example: &


The <model of format> of a chain cannot exceed 255 characters.

Any <model of format > can be represented by an alphanumeric variable, as shows it the following example:

    10 a$="FF######,.##"
    20 b$="!"
    30 PRINT USING a$;12345.6789;

    10 FOR z=0 TO 4095
    20 SOUND 1,z,1,12
    30 NEXT
    run

COMMAND: Allows the sound programming, using the following parameters:

Parameter 1: <channel state>

The <channel state> must be a whole number ranging between 1 and 255. The binary conversion of this parameter gives the significance of each bit according to the table of following correspondence:

Bit 0 (1 in decimal): output the sound on channel A
Bit 1 (2 in decimal): output the sound on channel B
Bit 2 (4 in decimal): output the sound on channel C
Bit 3 (8 in decimal): appointment with channel A
Bit 4 (16 in decimal): appointment with channel B
Bit 5 (32 in decimal): appointment with channel C
Bit 6 (64 in decimal): block a sound channel
Bit 7 (128 in decimal): empty a sound channel

The <channel state> 68, for example, will have the following effect:

Output on channel C (4), to the blocked state (64).

Parameter 2: <sound period>

This parameter establishes the height of the sound, i.e. the produced «note» (for example C, C#, D, D#, E). Each note is defined by a numerical value representing its <sound period>

Parameter 3: <duration>

This parameter establishes the length, or «duration», of the sound. A unit corresponds to a hundredth of second. The sound <duration> takes value 20 by defect, i.e. a fifth of second.

In the event of null <duration> parameter, the length of the sound will be that of the envelope of volume indicated.

If the <duration> parameter is negative, the volume envelope will be repeated during a number of times equal to the absolute value of the parameter.

Parameter 4: <volume>

This parameter establishes the initial sound volume of a note. It can take a value between 0 (null volume) and 15 (maximum volume). The computer chooses by defect value 12.

Parameter 5: <volume envelope>

It is possible to modulate the volume of a note during its execution using the command ENV. This command makes it possible to define in advance a maximum of fifteen different envelopes, coded from 1 to 15. The parameter <volume envelope> of the command SOUND then makes it possible to select one of these preset envelopes.

See ENV command

Parameter 6: <tonality envelope>

Period variations, therefore height, can be obtained during the execution of a note via the command ENT. This command enables you to define in advance a maximum of 15 different envelopes of tonalities, coded from 1 to 15. The parameter <tonality envelope> of the command SOUND then makes it possible to select one of these preset envelopes. If, in the command ENT, you used a negative number of envelope, the absolute value of this number will then be taken as parameter of the command SOUND.

See ENT command

Parameter 7: <noise period>

You have a choice of white noises which can be added or removed from the signal using the parameter <noise period> (value ranging between 0 and 31).

    run

COMMAND: Establishes the keyboard automatic repetition speed. The parameter <initial delay> fixes the reaction time (measured into fiftieth of seconds) between the depression of the key and the beginning of the automatic repetition. The <inter-repetitions interval> establishes the lapse of time separating the repetitions.

The command SPEED KEY relates to only the keys for which the automatic repetition exists implicitly or those for which this function was programmed with the command KEY DEF.

Before defining an automatic repetition with a very short <initial delay>, it is advisable to program one of the numerical keys in order to be able to restore the default settings of the function SPEED KEY (30,2). Here how to proceed:

     KEY 0, "SPEED KEY 30,2"+CHR$(13)

To return to the initial state, actuate key 0 of the numeric keypad.

    110 SYMBOL 105,line1,line2,line3,line4,line5,line6,line7,line8
    run

COMMAND: Redefines the form of a character posted to the screen. Each parameter takes a whole value located between 0 and 255.

In order to be in measurement to allot a place in memory to a redefined character, the computer must be prepared by the command:

    SYMBOL AFTER x

...where x is lower or equal to the character number to redefine.

One enters then the command SYMBOL, followed immediately by the character number x.

One can always reveal to the screen the character corresponding to the x value, even if it is not accessible from the keyboard. One uses for that the command:

    PRINT CHR$(x)

After SYMBOL x come the eight parameters defining one by one the eight lines constituting the character, starting from the top. Each parameter takes a value ranging between 0 and 255. It is the binary representation of the parameter which defines the corresponding line in the new character.

If, for example, one gives to the first parameter the value 1, the binary representation of the first line will be then: 00000001. The point corresponding to the 1 will appear in the character and will be color defined in the command PEN. On the other hand, the points corresponding to the 0 will be posted with the color PAPER, i.e. they will not appear. One can thus note that the character redefined in our example will comprise a point in the corner higher right. If one allots to the septs other parameters the values: 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 0, 0, one obtain the following binary representation:

parameter (line) 1: 00000001 (1 in decimal)
parameter (line) 2: 00000011 (3 in decimal)
parameter (line) 3: 00000111 (7 in decimal)
parameter (line) 4: 00001111 (15 in decimal)
parameter (line) 5: 00011111 (31 in decimal)
parameter (line) 6: 00111111 (63 in decimal)
parameter (line) 7: 00000000 (0 in decimal)
parameter (line) 8: 00000000 (0 in decimal)

This layout of the parameters transcribed into binary makes it possible to visualize the form of the new character. One can assign these parameters to the character number 255, for example, by the command:

    SYMBOL 255,1,3,7,15,63,0,0

It is noticed that it is useless to make appear the last two parameters insofar as they are null.

    SYMBOL 255,1,3,7,15,63

One can avoid to convert with decimal notation the binary symbols constituting the "drawing" of the character. It is enough for that to introduce the parameters directly in binary, without forgetting the prefix &X. In our case:

    SYMBOL 255,&X00000001,&X00000011,&X00000111,&X00001111
    &X00011111,&X00111111

Here now the command allowing to reveal the character.

    PRINT CHR$(255)

If parameters above are assigned with one of the keyboard characters, the redefined character will appear each time that the corresponding key will be actuated, just as at each command PRINT relating to it. This new character will be accepted by the BASIC like the equivalent of the replaced character.

    50 PRINT"in s"
    60 PRINT"one returns in a normal state while typing:"
    70 PRINT"SYMBOL AFTER 240"
    run

COMMAND: Fix the lower limit of the redefinable characters numbers (from 0 to 255). The default value of the whole number is 240, one has then 16 redefinable characters (between 240 and 255). When the <whole number> has for value 32, all the characters located between 32 and 255 are redefinable.The command SYMBOL AFTER 256 interdict thus any redefinition of character.

The command SYMBOL AFTER restores the default value of all the characters previously redefined.

The command SYMBOL AFTER canNOT work if the value of HIMEM were previously modified by a command MEMORY or by the opening of a file with OPENIN or OPENOUT. The computer posts in this case the error message «Improper argument», (unless the preceding state is SYMBOL AFTER 256).

    30 INPUT "give me a string of characters";a$
    40 OPENOUT "FILENAME"
    50 WRITE #9,a,a$
    60 CLOSEOUT:PRINT "Data are saved on the diskette"
    run

COMMAND: Post or WRITE data on the channel indicated. Two distinct articles must be separated by a comma and the character strings are placed between quotation marks.

In our example, the entered data will be written on channel #9, i.e. recorded on diskette.

To find the data, one will use the program below:

    10 REM recover the data from the diskette
    20 OPENIN "FILENAME":INPUT #9,a,a$
    30 CLOSEIN:PRINT"the 2 data are:"
    40 PRINT:PRINT a,a$
    run

XOR

<argument> XOR <argument>

    IF "alan" < "bernard" XOR "dog" > "cat" THEN PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"
       false
    IF "bernard" < "alan" XOR "cat" > "dog" THEN PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"
       false
    IF "alan" < "bernard" XOR "cat" > "dog" THEN PRINT "true" ELSE PRINT "false"
       true
     ....
    PRINT 1 XOR 1
       0
    PRINT 0 XOR 0
       0
    PRINT 1 XOR 0
       1

OPERATOR: Carry out bit by bit the boolean operation XOR (OR exclusive) on entireties. When bits of two arguments are not identical, the resulting bit is 1.
